I think the most interesting thing about the module is the ways to adjust for models that are biased. Though not implemented in my model as the lecture mentioned how the code was not meant for us to use but to be aware of.

Working on this assignment, I started to actually have a better understanding of the R workspace itself as I become more comfortable with it.
