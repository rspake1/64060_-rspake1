This Final was very difficuly for me as real world datasets are all formatted different and all have different issues. 

I originally worked on a Credit Card dataset to determine loan defaulting. After 20 hours of working on it, I thought I had finally built a good model, but going back through and testing, the algorithm could not detect an optimal k. 
I fought with that single line of code for HOURS.

At 3AM I decided to start all over and find a new dataset, which brought me to the dataset I am now using.

It is a dataset gathered by biologists about details from three different groups of penguins in Antarctica.
